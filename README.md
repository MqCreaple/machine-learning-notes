# My Notebooks for Machine Learning

Here are all the notebooks I wrote when learning about machine learning, from year 2022 till now.

All of these notebooks are based on the MNIST dataset. The `train.csv` and `test.csv` are not included in the repository. Please download them from <https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/25-million-images-0-99757-mnist/input> if you want to run my code.
